When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I would want to use a remote repository when I am working across multilpe machines
    or if I am working with multiple developers who need access to the files.  Also, I would
    want to use a remote repository for sharing access to my work with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Pulling changes manually enables a developer to decide when to update the files in 
    the working directory.  Automatically staying up-to-date with a remote repository
    might make unwanted file changes to a working directory if there are any changes
    to the remote.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks refer to clones that are specifically on GitHub.  A fork is when a GitHub user clones
    another GitHub user's repository onto their own GitHub account as their own repository.   clones
    would be used when duplicating a repository branch from a GitHub repository or from a local
    repository.  A branch is a single path of a git repository from head to initialization.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally allows the user to have access to the
    remote offline without needing internet connectivity.
