What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    A folder that is initialized as a git repository becomes tracked using the 
    git version control system where a ".git" folder is created to track metadata.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area provides a space to select specifically what files should be 
    included for a commit.  This is valuable in that commits can include specific 
    files rather than including changes for all the files in a repository so that
    commits can be separated more logically.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

    Although the working directory may have multiple changes across multiple files,
    using the staging area to select which specific files to use for a commit can
    be useful to split each commit logically between files
